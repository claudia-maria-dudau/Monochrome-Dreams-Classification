# Monochrome-Dreams-Classification
Classification of a set of monochrome images using different machine learning techniques:
- Naive Bayes Classifier (using the module MultinomialNB from the library sklearn)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (using both the distances l1 and l2 and various number of neighbors)
- Support Vector Classifier (using the svm module from the sklearn library and a linear kernel function)
- Neural Network (multilayered neural network using the sigmoid and softmax activation functions)
- Convolutional Neural Network (using the libraries tensorflow and keras)
